# HTBWriteups

### About Me
Hello, I’m Haidar! I’m passionate about cybersecurity and ethical hacking, and I’m constantly working to expand my skills through hands-on challenges like Hack The Box. I’m also **HTB CPTS** certified, which has helped me deepen my understanding of IT security.

I am always striving to improve and keep learning, aiming to become better and more proficient in cybersecurity every day.

This repository contains my personal writeups for retired **Hack The Box (HTB)** machines and challenges. I created this repo to document my journey of solving HTB machines and challenges, while also improving my knowledge and understanding of cybersecurity concepts.
