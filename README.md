# HTBWriteups
This repo contains my writeups for retired HackTheBox machines. These writeups outline the steps and solutions I used to complete the machines, and serve as a record of my learning journey in ethical hacking and penetration testing. I hope these can be helpful to others who are also learning or facing similar challenges.
